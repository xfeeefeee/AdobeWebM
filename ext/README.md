ext
===

This directory holds git submodules that point to libraries needed by the WebM plug-in.

These have been replaced by vcpkg.

You will need to manually add the following to this directory because the owners don't have a git repository I can embed:

* [Premiere CC 2019 (13.0) SDK](https://developer.adobe.com/content/udp/en/apis/creativecloud/premierepro.html)

Now using the Premiere Pro 24.0 SDK at ext/Premiere_Pro_24.0_SDK
